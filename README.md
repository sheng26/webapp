### Top 5 challenges
- Learning React. None of us know the React library, so we will need to learn how to use it in order to design our front end. 
- Making the user interface responsive to different screens like monitors, phones and tablets. We will need to explore Bootstrap features to make our web portal easy to use on different size screens.
- Implementing a scheduling algorithm that is reliable. We need to examine different ways of scheduling and displaying the schedule in a user friendly way.
- Learn how to use WebSockets in order to make the messaging feature responsive.
- Generate a pdf menu based on a specified template and information provided by the user. Figure out how to make a pdf document from data structures.
